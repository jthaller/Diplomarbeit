% Here we have a section where you might choose to acknoweldge your family, fellow students, advisor, dog, etc.

I would like to begin first and foremost by thanking my advisor (und Doktormutter), Professor Kate Jensen. She has had an incredibly positive impact on my life and influenced my trajectory after Williams more than anyone else. For that, I am eternally grateful and feel incredible fortunate to have been able work with her throughout the year. I also want to thank my friend and esteemed colleague Felix Knollmann, whose dedication to his own thesis helped encourage me to produce my best (read: most aesthetically pleasing) work and refrain from the procrastination that plagues any long term project. Next year I'll be perusing a graduate degree in materials science in Germany, a path I never would even have considered were it not for Felix and Kate. 

I also would like to thank my friends that have made my time at Williams such an enjoyable experience. From tubing down the Hoosic river with Sarah Ritzmann, to making soap with Marshall Borrus, to riding tandem bikes with Lucas Estrada, I'm blessed to have filled my (scarce) free-time with such bizarre and memorable experiences. That lack of free time is in part a result of my career on the track. I want to thank my coaches and teammates who have made these last four years such an incredible experience. Specifically, I want to thank coach Hoey and coach Barron, who may have taught me more about life than running itself. 

I would also like to thank my labmates, especially Josh Kang, who taught me both how to cure silicone and analyze it. It's been a pleasure working with Abdullah Nasir over the years. We first met while working together in Professor Majumder's lab, and I look forward to reading his thesis next year (probably written in crayon). Further, I really appreciate all the engineering help from Michael Taylor and Jason Mativi. Without them, this thesis would not have been possible.

Lastly, I would like to thank my parents. For raising me to always be curious, allowing me to attend Williams, and always supporting me in whatever ways they can, I am extremely grateful and fortunate.
