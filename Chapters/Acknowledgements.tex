% Here we have a section where you might choose to acknoweldge your family, fellow students, advisor, dog, etc.

I would like to begin first and foremost by thanking my advisor and Doktormutter, Professor Jensen. She has had an incredibly positive impact on my life and influenced my trajectory after Williams more than anyone else. For that, I am eternally grateful, and feel incredible fortunate to have been able work with her throughout the year. I would want to thank my friend and esteemed colleague Felix Knollmann, whose dedication to his own thesis helped encourage me to produce my best work and refrain from the procrastination that plagues any long term project. Next year I'll be perusing a masters in materials science in Germany, a path I never would have considered were it not for Felix and Kate. 

I would also like to thank my other friends that have made my time at Williams an enjoyable experience. From making soap with Marshall Borrus to riding tandem bikes with with Lucas Estrada, I'm pleased to have filled my time
