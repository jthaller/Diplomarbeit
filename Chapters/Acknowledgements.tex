I would like to begin first and foremost by thanking my advisor and Doktormutter, Professor Jensen. She has had an incredibly positive impact on my life and influenced my trajectory after Williams more than anyone else. For that, I am eternally grateful, and feel incredible fortunate to have been able work with her throughout the year. I also want to thank my friend and esteemed colleague Felix Knollmann, whose dedication to his own thesis helped encourage me to produce my best work and refrain from the procrastination that plagues any long term project. Next year I'll be perusing a masters in materials science in Germany, a path I never would have considered were it not for Felix and Kate. 

I would also like to thank my other friends that have made my time at Williams an enjoyable experience. From making soap with Marshall Borrus to riding tandem bikes with with Lucas Estrada, I'm pleased to have filled my not running or doing physics with such memorable experiences. 

Speaking of running, I absolutely must thank Coach Hoey and Coach Barron, who may ave taught me more about life than running itself. 

I would also like to thank my labmates, especially Josh Kang, who taught me both how to cure silicone and how to analyze it. It's been a pleasure working with Abdullah Nasir over the years. We first met while working together in Professor Majumder's lab, and I look forward to reading his thesis next year. I really appreciate all the engineering help from Michael Taylor and Jason Mativi. Without them, this thesis would not have been possible.

Lastly, I would like to thank my parents. For raising me to always be curious, allowing me to attend Williams, and always supporting me in whatever ways they can, I am extremely grateful and fortunate.
