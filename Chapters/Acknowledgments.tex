% Here we have a section where you might choose to acknoweldge your family, fellow students, advisor, dog, etc.

The acknowledgment section is optional, but most theses will include one.  Feel free to thank anyone who contributed to your effort if the mood strikes you.  Inside jokes and small pieces of humor are fairly common here \ldots

Make sure to include:
KEJ, Mr. Josh Kang, Abdullah, Michael Taylor and Jason, Professor Strait for teaching me everything I know about Vibrations, Waves, and Optics.  
Professor Majumbles. Probably my track coaches
