In this chapter I present the surface stress and adhesion energy data collected for two types of silicone with various stiffnesses. We first used Gelest to obtain our preliminary data and tune the operation of our device. We then switched to Dow-Corning to continue more extensive measurements. 


\section{Organosilicon Polymer Chemistry}

\emph{MUST MOVE THIS. I should definitely talk about what the heck Silicone actually is, and what we're really using, and frankly why gels are stretchy. I think that I should say something in the introduction, and maybe designate an appendix if I want to go more in depth.} 

PDMS, or Poly-Dimethyl-Siloxane, is a commonly used gel in the field of soft condensed matter. The gel is composed of a polymer network of crosslinkers, as well as a second polymer in the fluid phase. When stretched, the configuration of the system changes such that the tangled crosslinkers begin to unwind and untangle. From a statistical mechanics perspective, this decreases the configurational entropy, thus increasing the free energy. \emph{Which free energy though? I think this is what we're covering next in 302...Also I got this from that unpublished review article}

Below (Fig. \ref{fig:DMS-V31}) is the chemical structure for the vinyl-terminated PDMS (Gelest) that comprises the fluid phase.

The crosslinker for the system is a trimethylsiloxane terminated 25-35\% methylhydrosiloxane - dimethylsiloxane copolymer. The crosslinker is much shorter on average than the PDMS, containing roughly 20-30 repeating monomer groups. The single hydrogen on the methylhudrosiloxane is weakly bound, and can be replaced by one of the hydrogen atoms in the PDMS. This bonding happens over and over again, creating the long twisted chains that create the mesh network of the gel. Increasing density of crosslinkers provides an easy and controllable method to vary the gel's stiffness.

\section{Preliminary Data}
Because Figure \ref{fig:2017natcomfig} was obtained using Dow-Corning silicone gel, our intention from the start was to use this material in our adhesion based measurements. Because the material was back-ordered, we used Gelest instead while we calibrated the process. I present this preliminary data because it shows clear incremental steps of evidence that the surface stress for the substrate is increasing under strain.  
\subsection{Raw Data Files}
Below (Fig. \ref{fig:190215g91glasssphere011surface}) is a raw data image.

\end{figure}
The ``black hole'' like image in the top-left corner is the silica sphere. Each small white dot represents a fluorescent bead; together they create a sea of stars that outline the surface plane and the silica sphere. Figure \ref{fig:190215g91glasssphere011surface} is an example of the upper limit of bead coverage density. Any higher concentration of fluorescent beads could result in a difficulty in light bleeding. Note, the sphere is in the top corner of the image to provide maximum information about the leveling of the surface plane. We assume that the surface effects are symmetrical for zero applied strain and equibiaxial strain. Thus, it is more important to gather information in one direction to properly level the surface plane to determine the depth into which the sphere sinks. 

For each sphere, we take a stack of 50-100 images, depending on the size of the sphere.

\subsection{Standard Candles}
Not only do we measure the depth and radii for a range of spheres, but we also measure a select few spheres at every strain. This allows us to track how any given sphere is changing, increasing our confidence that the shift in $\Upsilon$ and W is not just an artifact of noise. Below is the side profile for Gelest 9:1 ($\text{E}=6.3$ kPa). Notice how the profile shifts noticeably upwards to be flattened when the substrate is stretched. This shift is expected if the surface stress is increasing (see equation \ref{THEeqn}).
