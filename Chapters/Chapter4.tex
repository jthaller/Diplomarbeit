In this chapter I present the surface stress and adhesion energy data collected for two types of silicone with various stiffnesses. We first used Gelest to obtain our preliminary data and tune the operation of our device. We then switched to Dow-Corning to continue more extensive measurements. 


\section{Organosilicon Polymer Chemistry}
\label{section:polychem}
\emph{MUST MOVE THIS. I should definitely talk about what the heck Silicone actually is, and what we're really using, and frankly why gels are stretchy. I think that I should say something in the introduction, and maybe designate an appendix if I want to go more in depth.} 

PDMS, or Poly-Dimethyl-Siloxane, is a commonly used gel in the field of soft condensed matter. The gel is composed of a polymer network of crosslinkers, as well as a second polymer in the fluid phase. When stretched, the configuration of the system changes such that the tangled crosslinkers begin to unwind and untangle. From a statistical mechanics perspective, this decreases the configurational entropy, thus increasing the free energy. \emph{Which free energy though? I think this is what we're covering next in 302...Also I got this from that unpublished review article}

Below (Fig. \ref{fig:DMS-V31}) is the chemical structure for the vinyl-terminated PDMS (Gelest) that comprises the fluid phase.

The crosslinker for the system is a trimethylsiloxane terminated 25-35\% methylhydrosiloxane - dimethylsiloxane copolymer. The crosslinker is much shorter on average than the PDMS, containing roughly 20-30 repeating monomer groups. The single hydrogen on the methylhudrosiloxane is weakly bound, and can be replaced by one of the hydrogen atoms in the PDMS. This bonding happens over and over again, creating the long twisted chains that create the mesh network of the gel. Increasing density of crosslinkers provides an easy and controllable method to vary the gel's stiffness.

\subsubsection{Overly Specific Silcone Preparation and Spin Coating}\todo[inline,color=green]{This whole section needs to be fixed. It's a detailed version of the outline in ch. 2}
\emph{this probably sounds unclear. Change Later}. We know the stiffness of the gel we are curing, and by having a thick enough coating, we can ensure that the microspheres are only interacting with this gel. 100 $\mu m$ is a reasonable aim, and our substrates generally are between $80-100$ $\mu m$. The second concern is with thickness. In principal, as long as the surface is locally flat with respect to each microsphere, we can determine where the surface level lies and still measure the depth. In reality, it is not difficult to produce an even coating of silicone using a spin-coater. 

Before spin-coating it is useful to coat the underlayer with fluorescent beads. It is not vital, but this is helpful in determining the substrate's thickness. The only information obtained by this coating is the location of the substrate's bottom surface, so a dense bead coverage is not required, and could potentially be harmful if there is light bleeding. I suggest coating the bottom surface with 40nm beads for 1 minute. Full directions for preparing a fluroescent bead solution can be found in Appendix B. After this time, you may return the fluorescent beads back to the solution for re-use. A significant number of beads will remain on the underlayer. To remove some excess, gently wash the substrate with de-ionized water. For a coverslip, simply submerge the entire slip in water and gently remove it at a 45\degree angle, trying to prevent the water from breaking-up into smaller droplets. This process is slightly more difficult for the petri dish due to the larger size. I suggest  (either) using a very large container of water (it can be shallow, really you just need a large opening). If this proves challenging, I have found success using a 1000mL beaker tilted at an angle. It is also possible to use an autopipet for washing; repeat the same process used for the fluorescent bead coating, only use water this time. I have had mixed success with this technique, however. It often leaves a water droplet and has led to an uneven coating of fluorescent beads, manifested as streaks across the surface.

Depending on the silicone, a different amount of time should be waited before spin coating onto the desired surface. We coat our substrate onto glass for "zero applied strain" data or onto PDMS \emph{yeah I gotta look up the brand when I get back. I totally forget.} for stretching data. It is best that the silicone is far enough along in the curing process that it has enough stiffness and cohesiveness to remain on the underlayer when spun. As an extreme example, consider trying to spin-coat water; it would all fling off the underlayer. \emph{is there a better term than underlayer. I'm thinking of the general term for what we use a coverslip or stretchy circle}. For Gelest 9:1, there is no waiting time necessary; Gelest 9:1 cures rapidly. For Dow Corning 1:1, a wait time before spinning of 1 hour was observed. 

To help with the evenness of the coating, it is useful to degas the gel by leaving it in a vacuum chamber for a few minutes. A few small bubbles are not of concern, as the process of transferring the gel to the underlayer is enough to pop any remaining stragglers. I have found that a "glob" of gel roughly half the diameter of the underlayer, with the spin-coater set to 500rpm for 40sec is enough to create an even coating of roughly 100 $\mu m$.  

Coating a coverslip with silicone is a straightfoward process where hardly anything can go wrong. Coating the stretchable PDMS underlayer, however, requires some creativity to find the steps necessary to return the best results. I cut the PDMS disk with an X-acto knife and using a standard Petri \emph{2.5in diameter ...look up} dish as a template. In order to avoid snagging, I suggest cutting out the circle before removing the paper sheets on both sides of the silicone. Taping the Petri dish to the paper is also helpful prevent the dish from slipping while cutting. Unlike the glass coverslip, the PDMS underlayer is not rigid and must be place on a ridgid surface, such as a Petri dish, for spin coating. This leave the possibility that air bubbles could be trapped in between the PDMS and the Petri dish. This is a surefire way to ensure an uneven and frustrating substrate. I suggest removing the top paper sheet of the newly cut PDMS, then placing the Petri dish down upon the exposed silicone. You should now have a Petri dish with a silicone disk on top and a paper sheet on top of that. Using your thumbs, simply do your best to push all the air bubbles from the center outwards. Finally, any tiny air bubbles can hopefully be removed by placing the Petri dish in a vacuum chamber for a few minutes. Now you can coat the PDMS with fluorescent beads and wash as desired before place the petri dish onto the spin-coater and proceeding as described above.

After spin-coating, the silicone requires time to cure. We cure Dow-Corning 1:1 for at room temperature for at least 24 hours. For Gelest 9:1, we oven cure at $70 \degree$ C for at least 24 hours. Either silicone can be cured at room temperature or in the oven so long as a sufficient amount of time is waited, however, we have used this methods to maintain consistency, as well as parallel the techniques used in previous literature \cite{xu2017direct}.

After the silicone cures, it is time to coat the surface with fluorescent beads again. It is important that the beads are dense enough to give a high resolution, yet not so dense as to become indistinguishable; this presents a challenge the MATLAB particle locating software. Secondly, too dense a bead coverage risks light bleeding to vertically adjacent stacks. For the 40nm bead solution prescribed in Appendix B, I suggest letting the solution soak for up to 3 minutes before removing and washing the substrate. While the fluorescent beads chosen are most susceptible to light at \emph{shoot, what wavelength? Like 440?} nm, there is still the risk of photobleaching the fluorophores, and worth dimming the lights in the lab when working with them. 

\section{Preliminary Data: Gelest}
Because Figure \ref{fig:2017natcomfig} was obtained using Dow-Corning silicone gel, our intention from the start was to use this material in our adhesion based measurements. Because the material was back-ordered, we used Gelest instead while we calibrated the process. I present this preliminary data because it shows clear incremental steps of evidence that the surface stress for the substrate is increasing under strain.  

\subsection{Standard Candles}
Not only do we measure the depth and radii for a range of spheres, but we also measure a select few spheres at every strain. This allows us to track how any given sphere is changing, increasing our confidence that the shift in $\Upsilon$ and W is not just an artifact of noise. Below is the side profile for Gelest 9:1 ($\text{E}=6.3$ kPa). Notice how the profile shifts noticeably upwards to be flattened when the substrate is stretched. This shift is expected if the surface stress is increasing (see equation \ref{THEeqn}).
