\section{Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy}
Confocal Microscopy is a technique capable of probing a sample with true 3-Dimensional optical resolution. The technique works by only allowing in focus light through a pinhole. By changing the plane of focus, one can traverse an object azimuthally or reconstruct a full three-dimensional image by compiling a ``stack'' of these images.

Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy works by the same general principle, only with the added complexity of optically-excitable fluorophores. These fluorophores absorb light from a narrow range of frequencies and re-emmit fluorescent light at a different known and specific frequency, which can then be measured. This allows for a greater resolution to larger objects, as well as the ability to detect objects that would otherwise be invisible to the microscope.  

Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy works by illuminating the specimen with a laser. The laser light passes through a pinhole, then is reflected by the dichroic mirror and then focused by the objective lens on a small area of the specimen. The re-emitted light from the fluorophores has a longer wavelength than the laser, so it is then transmitted through mirror.  It then then passes through the pinhole where it is travels to the photo-detector.

\subsection{Preparing a Fluorescent Bead Solution}
Make sure to also note that the solution should be wrapped to avoid light exposure and to keep them in the refrigerator. \todo[inline, color=yellow]{I think the actual borate buffer recipe might belong in an appendix}

\section{Image Analysis}
In the following section, we will step through the process of analyzing a single sphere. Recall that in order to determine the surface stress and adhesion energy, we must fit a line to a collection of spheres ranging in size.  
\todo[inline,color=yellow]{Insert raw data file....currently it's in chapter 4. It should be in here instead}

\subsection{Particle Location}
To turn a raw image file (saved as a .ome.tif) into usable data, we use sophisticated MATLAB program to locate each fluorescent bead. Plotted for the sphere in Figure \ref{fig:190215g91glasssphere011surface}
