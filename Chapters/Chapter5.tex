\emph{I still feel like pushing things off and saying, ``oh I'll get to this before my thesis is due,'' yet deadlines are approaching and I guess I need to face reality.} As boasted, the adhesion based technique for measuring $\Upsilon(\epsilon)$ should be applicable to any soft solid capable of being stretched. Naturally, we would like to expand our measurements beyond silicone. Hydrogels, aerogels, and gelatins, to name a few, are objects of interest. Commercial adhesives are a subject of financial interest, with possible consequential technological developments.

\section{Neue Materialen: Gummib√§rli}
Measuring the strain dependent surface stress of a gummy bear presents challenges not present in PDMS silicone. For example, gummy bears come in a predefined size and shape. In order to spin coat them on our apparatus, we must first melt down the gummies. Gummy bears are composed primarily of gelatin and a glucose syrup. When melted, \emph{I should chat with adam about what's happening to continue this section.}
