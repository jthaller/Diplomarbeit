%This thesis describes a new technique devised to measure strain-dependent surface stress in soft matter. This technique is groundbreaking in that unlike previous methods, it is applicable to a wide range of materials. I provide the explanations and derivations for the methodology, as well as provide links to the CAD documents required to induce the controllable strain in soft, thin substrates. Git Test

%Additionally, we measure the strain-dependent surface stress in materials ranging from PDMS Silicone to a gummy bear, demonstrating that this is a common property of soft matter, despite previous assumptions by the field.

Surface stress, or surface tension, is a fundamental material property of interfaces. However, our understanding of solid surface tension and how it changes with deformation remains limited because it is difficult to measure in traditional stiff materials. Soft materials, including gels, provide a unique opportunity to measure these fundamental properties because they can be stretched elastically to very large strains. In this thesis, we have developed a new, adhesion-based approach to measure the solid surface stress of compliant materials as a function of applied strain. This approach is applicable to a wide range of soft materials.
