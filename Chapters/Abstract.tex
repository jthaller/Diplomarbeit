Surface stress, or surface tension, is a fundamental material property of interfaces. However, our understanding of solid surface tension and how it changes with deformation remains limited because it is difficult to measure in traditional stiff materials. Soft materials, including gels, provide a unique opportunity to measure these fundamental properties because they can be stretched elastically to very large strains. In this thesis, we have developed a new, adhesion-based approach to measure the solid surface stress of compliant materials as a function of applied strain. We measure the spontaneous indentation depth as a function of radius for rigid spheres adhered to compliant, sticky substrates, then fit the results to theory to obtain the surface stress, $ \Upsilon $ and adhesion energy, $ W $. By subsequently stretching the substrates biaxially and repeating the experiment, we obtain $ \Upsilon $ and $ W $ as a function of strain, $ \epsilon $. This approach is applicable to a wide range of soft materials. In this thesis, we report preliminary measurements for two types of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).
