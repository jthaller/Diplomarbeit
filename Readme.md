## Diplomarbeit
All the related tex files of my undergraduate honors thesis. Since it was entirely coded in Latex, it made sense to continually back-up all the files on github. To read my thesis, you can check out the PDF in the repository or find the published version [HERE](https://unbound.williams.edu/theses/islandora/object/studenttheses%3A1449)
