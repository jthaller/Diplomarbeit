  abstract  = {Recent experiments have reported that the surface stress of soft elastic solids can increase rapidly with surface strain. For example{,} when a small hard sphere in adhesive contact with a soft silicone gel is slowly retracted from its rest position{,} it was found that the retraction force versus displacement relation cannot be explained either by the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) theory or a recent indentation theory based on an isotropic surface stress that is independent of surface strain. In this paper{,} we address this problem using a finite element method to simulate the retraction process. Our numerical model does not have the restrictions of the aforementioned theories; that is{,} it can handle large nonlinear elastic deformation as well as a surface-strain-dependent surface stress. Our simulation is in good agreement with experimental force versus displacement data with no fitting parameters. Therefore{,} our results lend further support to the claim that significant strain-dependent surface stresses can occur in simple soft elastic gels. However{,} significant challenges remain in the reconciliation of theory and experiments{,} particularly regarding the geometry of the contact and substrate deformation.},
